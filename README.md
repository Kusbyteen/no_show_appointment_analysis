### Question(s) for Analysis
> 1. Which particular disease patients show up more for their appointment. <br>
> 2. Does the scholarship package has an influence on the show up?
> 3. Which age group usually show up the most. Or does age affect the show up? <br>
> 4. Does SMS alert influence the show up 



## Conclusions

> Analysis from the EDA step shows that:

> Patients who are negetive for either diabetes or hipertension are more show up for their appointment than those who positive for the two conditions

> Also, it was found that gender plays a role on the show since more females show up more than males. This can be concluded that females are more likely to show up for their appointment than males.

> Age also has influence on the show. From the analysis, more old age and children show up for their appointment than young adults.

> Last the scholarship package turn not have an influence on the show up since patients with scholarship package show less than those with scholarship package

## Limitation
> More data is need to be able to know which particular day amongst the days of the week do people set as their appointment and what is the show up pattern amongst the days of the week

> With regards to the data collection, there has no been any mention of how it was collected, there is question of the validity of the data
